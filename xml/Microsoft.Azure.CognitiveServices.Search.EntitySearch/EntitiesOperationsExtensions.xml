            The user's search term.
            </param>
        <param name="acceptLanguage">
            A comma-delimited list of one or more languages to use for user interface
            strings. The list is in decreasing order of preference. For additional
            information, including expected format, see
            [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). This
            header and the setLang query parameter are mutually exclusive; do not
            specify both. If you set this header, you must also specify the cc query
            parameter. Bing will use the first supported language it finds from the
            list, and combine that language with the cc parameter value to determine
            the market to return results for. If the list does not include a supported
            language, Bing will find the closest language and market that supports the
            request, and may use an aggregated or default market for the results
            instead of a specified one. You should use this header and the cc query
            parameter only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise, you should use
            the mkt and setLang query parameters. A user interface string is a string
            that's used as a label in a user interface. There are very few user
            interface strings in the JSON response objects. Any links in the response
            objects to Bing.com properties will apply the specified language.
            </param>
        <param name="pragma">
            By default, Bing returns cached content, if available. To prevent Bing from
            returning cached content, set the Pragma header to no-cache (for example,
            Pragma: no-cache).
            </param>
        <param name="userAgent">
            The user agent originating the request. Bing uses the user agent to provide
            mobile users with an optimized experience. Although optional, you are
            strongly encouraged to always specify this header. The user-agent should be
            the same string that any commonly used browser would send. For information
            about user agents, see [RFC
            2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).
            </param>
        <param name="clientId">
            Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior across Bing
            API calls. Bing often flights new features and improvements, and it uses
            the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on different flights. If you
            do not use the same client ID for a user across multiple requests, then
            Bing may assign the user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to
            multiple conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience.
            For example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than
            the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client
            ID to tailor web results to that client ID’s search history, providing a
            richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header to help improve
            result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The
            relevance improvements help with better quality of results delivered by
            Bing APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the API
            consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this header
            required. Persisting the client ID across multiple requests for the same
            end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a
            consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better
            quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application
            on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not
            include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in
            the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should NOT
            include this header in a request is the first time the user uses your app
            on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API request that your app
            makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist the ID
            in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used
            across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other apps such as
            mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The
            next time the user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that you
            persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this header. If the
            response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all
            subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you include the
            X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
            </param>
        <param name="clientIp">
            The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The IP address is used to
            discover the user's location. Bing uses the location information to
            determine safe search behavior. Although optional, you are encouraged to
            always specify this header and the X-Search-Location header. Do not
            obfuscate the address (for example, by changing the last octet to 0).
            Obfuscating the address results in the location not being anywhere near the
            device's actual location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous
            results.
            </param>
        <param name="location">
            A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that describe the client's
            geographical location. Bing uses the location information to determine safe
            search behavior and to return relevant local content. Specify the key/value
            pair as &lt;key&gt;:&lt;value&gt;. The following are the keys that you use
            to specify the user's location. lat (required): The latitude of the
            client's location, in degrees. The latitude must be greater than or equal
            to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern
            latitudes and positive values indicate northern latitudes. long (required):
            The longitude of the client's location, in degrees. The longitude must be
            greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative
            values indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern
            longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the
            horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by the
            device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m
            for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts
            (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the location.
            (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.) head
            (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of travel. Specify
            the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360, counting clockwise
            relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp
            (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the
            client device is traveling. alt (optional): The altitude of the client
            device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies
            the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you
            specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more
            information that you provide, the more accurate the location results are.
            Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's
            geographical location. Providing the location is especially important if
            the client's IP address does not accurately reflect the user's physical
            location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you
            should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a
            minimum, you should include this header.
            </param>
        <param name="countryCode">
            A 2-character country code of the country where the results come from. This
            API supports only the United States market. If you specify this query
            parameter, it must be set to us. If you set this parameter, you must also
            specify the Accept-Language header. Bing uses the first supported language
            it finds from the languages list, and combine that language with the
            country code that you specify to determine the market to return results
            for. If the languages list does not include a supported language, Bing
            finds the closest language and market that supports the request, or it may
            use an aggregated or default market for the results instead of a specified
            one. You should use this query parameter and the Accept-Language query
            parameter only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise, you should use
            the mkt and setLang query parameters. This parameter and the mkt query
            parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
            </param>
        <param name="market">
            The market where the results come from. You are strongly encouraged to
            always specify the market, if known. Specifying the market helps Bing route
            the request and return an appropriate and optimal response. This parameter
            and the cc query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
            </param>
        <param name="responseFilter">
            A comma-delimited list of answers to include in the response. If you do not
            specify this parameter, the response includes all search answers for which
            there's relevant data.
            </param>
        <param name="responseFormat">
            The media type to use for the response. The following are the possible
            case-insensitive values: JSON, JSONLD. The default is JSON. If you specify
            JSONLD, the response body includes JSON-LD objects that contain the search
            results.
            </param>
        <param name="safeSearch">
            A filter used to filter adult content. Off: Return webpages with adult
            text, images, or videos. Moderate: Return webpages with adult text, but not
            adult images or videos. Strict: Do not return webpages with adult text,
            images, or videos. The default is Moderate. If the request comes from a
            market that Bing's adult policy requires that safeSearch is set to Strict,
            Bing ignores the safeSearch value and uses Strict. If you use the site:
            query operator, there is the chance that the response may contain adult
            content regardless of what the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use
            site: only if you are aware of the content on the site and your scenario
            supports the possibility of adult content. Possible values include: 'Off',
            'Moderate', 'Strict'
            </param>
        <param name="setLang">
            The language to use for user interface strings. Specify the language using
            the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code. For example, the language code for
            English is EN. The default is EN (English). Although optional, you should
            always specify the language. Typically, you set setLang to the same
            language specified by mkt unless the user wants the user interface strings
            displayed in a different language. This parameter and the Accept-Language
            header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string
            is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user
            interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com
            properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
            </param>
        <summary>
            The Entity Search API lets you send a search query to Bing and get back
            search results that include entities and places. Place results include
            restaurants, hotel, or other local businesses. For places, the query can
            specify the name of the local business or it can ask for a list (for
            example, restaurants near me). Entity results include persons, places, or
            things. Place in this context is tourist attractions, states, countries,
            etc.

            By default, Bing returns cached content, if available. To prevent Bing from
            returning cached content, set the Pragma header to no-cache (for example,
            Pragma: no-cache).
            </param>
        <param name="userAgent">
            The user agent originating the request. Bing uses the user agent to provide
            mobile users with an optimized experience. Although optional, you are
            strongly encouraged to always specify this header. The user-agent should be
            the same string that any commonly used browser would send. For information
            about user agents, see [RFC
            2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).
            </param>
        <param name="clientId">
            Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior across Bing
            API calls. Bing often flights new features and improvements, and it uses
            the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on different flights. If you
            do not use the same client ID for a user across multiple requests, then
            Bing may assign the user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to
            multiple conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience.
            For example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than
            the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client
            ID to tailor web results to that client ID’s search history, providing a
            richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header to help improve
            result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The
            relevance improvements help with better quality of results delivered by
            Bing APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the API
            consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this header
            required. Persisting the client ID across multiple requests for the same
            end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a
            consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better
            quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application
            on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not
            include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in
            the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should NOT
            include this header in a request is the first time the user uses your app
            on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API request that your app
            makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist the ID
            in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used
            across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other apps such as
            mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The
            next time the user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that you
            persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this header. If the
            response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all
            subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you include the
            X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
            </param>
        <param name="clientIp">
            The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The IP address is used to
            discover the user's location. Bing uses the location information to
            determine safe search behavior. Although optional, you are encouraged to
            always specify this header and the X-Search-Location header. Do not
            obfuscate the address (for example, by changing the last octet to 0).
            Obfuscating the address results in the location not being anywhere near the
            device's actual location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous
            results.
            </param>
        <param name="location">
            A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that describe the client's
            geographical location. Bing uses the location information to determine safe
            search behavior and to return relevant local content. Specify the key/value
            pair as &lt;key&gt;:&lt;value&gt;. The following are the keys that you use
            to specify the user's location. lat (required): The latitude of the
            client's location, in degrees. The latitude must be greater than or equal
            to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern
            latitudes and positive values indicate northern latitudes. long (required):
            The longitude of the client's location, in degrees. The longitude must be
            greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative
            values indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern
            longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the
            horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by the
            device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m
            for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts
            (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the location.
            (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.) head
            (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of travel. Specify
            the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360, counting clockwise
            relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp
            (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the
            client device is traveling. alt (optional): The altitude of the client
            device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies
            the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you
            specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more
            information that you provide, the more accurate the location results are.
            Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's
            geographical location. Providing the location is especially important if
            the client's IP address does not accurately reflect the user's physical
            location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you
            should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a
            minimum, you should include this header.
            </param>
        <param name="countryCode">
            A 2-character country code of the country where the results come from. This
            API supports only the United States market. If you specify this query
            parameter, it must be set to us. If you set this parameter, you must also
            specify the Accept-Language header. Bing uses the first supported language
            it finds from the languages list, and combine that language with the
            country code that you specify to determine the market to return results
            for. If the languages list does not include a supported language, Bing
            finds the closest language and market that supports the request, or it may
            use an aggregated or default market for the results instead of a specified
            one. You should use this query parameter and the Accept-Language query
            parameter only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise, you should use
            the mkt and setLang query parameters. This parameter and the mkt query
            parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
            </param>
        <param name="market">
            The market where the results come from. You are strongly encouraged to
            always specify the market, if known. Specifying the market helps Bing route
            the request and return an appropriate and optimal response. This parameter
            and the cc query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
            </param>
        <param name="responseFilter">
            A comma-delimited list of answers to include in the response. If you do not
            specify this parameter, the response includes all search answers for which
            there's relevant data.
            </param>
        <param name="responseFormat">
            The media type to use for the response. The following are the possible
            case-insensitive values: JSON, JSONLD. The default is JSON. If you specify
            JSONLD, the response body includes JSON-LD objects that contain the search
            results.
            </param>
        <param name="safeSearch">
            A filter used to filter adult content. Off: Return webpages with adult
            text, images, or videos. Moderate: Return webpages with adult text, but not
            adult images or videos. Strict: Do not return webpages with adult text,
            images, or videos. The default is Moderate. If the request comes from a
            market that Bing's adult policy requires that safeSearch is set to Strict,
            Bing ignores the safeSearch value and uses Strict. If you use the site:
            query operator, there is the chance that the response may contain adult
            content regardless of what the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use
            site: only if you are aware of the content on the site and your scenario
            supports the possibility of adult content. Possible values include: 'Off',
            'Moderate', 'Strict'
            </param>
        <param name="setLang">
            The language to use for user interface strings. Specify the language using
            the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code. For example, the language code for
            English is EN. The default is EN (English). Although optional, you should
            always specify the language. Typically, you set setLang to the same
            language specified by mkt unless the user wants the user interface strings
            displayed in a different language. This parameter and the Accept-Language
            header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string
            is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user
            interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com
            properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
            </param>
        <param name="cancellationToken">
            The cancellation token.
            </param>
        <summary>
            The Entity Search API lets you send a search query to Bing and get back
            search results that include entities and places. Place results include
            restaurants, hotel, or other local businesses. For places, the query can
            specify the name of the local business or it can ask for a list (for
            example, restaurants near me). Entity results include persons, places, or
            things. Place in this context is tourist attractions, states, countries,
            etc.
