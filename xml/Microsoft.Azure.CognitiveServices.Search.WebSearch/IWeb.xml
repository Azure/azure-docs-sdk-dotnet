      <Docs>
        <param name="query">
            The user's search query term. The term may not be empty. The term
            may contain Bing Advanced Operators. For example, to limit results
            to a specific domain, use the site: operator.
            </param>
        <param name="acceptLanguage">
            A comma-delimited list of one or more languages to use for user
            interface strings. The list is in decreasing order of preference.
            For additional information, including expected format, see
            [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).
            This header and the setLang query parameter are mutually exclusive;
            do not specify both. If you set this header, you must also specify
            the cc query parameter. Bing will use the first supported language
            it finds from the list, and combine that language with the cc
            parameter value to determine the market to return results for. If
            the list does not include a supported language, Bing will find the
            closest language and market that supports the request, and may use
            an aggregated or default market for the results instead of a
            specified one. You should use this header and the cc query
            parameter only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise, you
            should use the mkt and setLang query parameters. A user interface
            string is a string that's used as a label in a user interface.
            There are very few user interface strings in the JSON response
            objects. Any links in the response objects to Bing.com properties
            will apply the specified language.
            </param>
        <param name="pragma">
            By default, Bing returns cached content, if available. To prevent
            Bing from returning cached content, set the Pragma header to
            no-cache (for example, Pragma: no-cache).
            </param>
        <param name="userAgent">
            The user agent originating the request. Bing uses the user agent to
            provide mobile users with an optimized experience. Although
            optional, you are strongly encouraged to always specify this
            header. The user-agent should be the same string that any commonly
            used browser would send. For information about user agents, see
            [RFC 2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).
            </param>
        <param name="clientId">
            Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior
            across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new features and
            improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning
            traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID
            for a user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user
            to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple
            conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience.
            For example, if the second request has a different flight
            assignment than the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also,
            Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that client
            ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user.
            Bing also uses this header to help improve result rankings by
            analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The relevance
            improvements help with better quality of results delivered by Bing
            APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the API
            consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this
            header required. Persisting the client ID across multiple requests
            for the same end user and device combination enables 1) the API
            consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher
            click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing
            APIs. Each user that uses your application on the device must have
            a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not include this
            header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in the
            X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should
            NOT include this header in a request is the first time the user
            uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API
            request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist
            the client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent
            HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not
            use a session cookie. For other apps such as mobile apps, use the
            device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the
            user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that you
            persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this header. If
            the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it
            for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If
            you include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in
            the request.
            </param>
        <param name="clientIp">
            The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The IP address is
            used to discover the user's location. Bing uses the location
            information to determine safe search behavior. Although optional,
            you are encouraged to always specify this header and the
            X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for
            example, by changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address
            results in the location not being anywhere near the device's actual
            location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous results.
            </param>
        <param name="location">
            A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that describe the
            client's geographical location. Bing uses the location information
            to determine safe search behavior and to return relevant local
            content. Specify the key/value pair as &lt;key&gt;:&lt;value&gt;.
            The following are the keys that you use to specify the user's
            location. lat (required): The latitude of the client's location, in
            degrees. The latitude must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and
            less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern
            latitudes and positive values indicate northern latitudes. long
            (required): The longitude of the client's location, in degrees. The
            longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or
            equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and
            positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The
            radius, in meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the
            coordinates. Pass the value returned by the device's location
            service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell
            tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts
            (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
            location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since
            January 1, 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or
            direction of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees
            from 0 through 360, counting clockwise relative to true north.
            Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp (optional): The
            horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the client
            device is traveling. alt (optional): The altitude of the client
            device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that
            specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this
            key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are
            optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate
            the location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to
            always specify the user's geographical location. Providing the
            location is especially important if the client's IP address does
            not accurately reflect the user's physical location (for example,
            if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you should include
            this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a minimum, you
            should include this header.
            </param>
        <param name="answerCount">
            The number of answers that you want the response to include. The
            answers that Bing returns are based on ranking. For example, if
            Bing returns webpages, images, videos, and relatedSearches for a
            request and you set this parameter to two (2), the response
            includes webpages and images.If you included the responseFilter
            query parameter in the same request and set it to webpages and
            news, the response would include only webpages.
            </param>
        <param name="countryCode">
            A 2-character country code of the country where the results come
            from. This API supports only the United States market. If you
            specify this query parameter, it must be set to us. If you set this
            parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language header. Bing
            uses the first supported language it finds from the languages list,
            and combine that language with the country code that you specify to
            determine the market to return results for. If the languages list
            does not include a supported language, Bing finds the closest
            language and market that supports the request, or it may use an
            aggregated or default market for the results instead of a specified
            one. You should use this query parameter and the Accept-Language
            query parameter only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise,
            you should use the mkt and setLang query parameters. This parameter
            and the mkt query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify
            both.
            </param>
        <param name="count">
            The number of search results to return in the response. The default
            is 10 and the maximum value is 50. The actual number delivered may
            be less than requested.Use this parameter along with the offset
            parameter to page results.For example, if your user interface
            displays 10 search results per page, set count to 10 and offset to
            0 to get the first page of results. For each subsequent page,
            increment offset by 10 (for example, 0, 10, 20). It is possible for
            multiple pages to include some overlap in results.
            </param>
        <param name="freshness">
            Filter search results by the following age values: Day—Return
            webpages that Bing discovered within the last 24 hours. Week—Return
            webpages that Bing discovered within the last 7 days. Month—Return
            webpages that discovered within the last 30 days. This filter
            applies only to webpage results and not to the other results such
            as news and images. Possible values include: 'Day', 'Week', 'Month'
            </param>
        <param name="market">
            The market where the results come from. Typically, mkt is the
            country where the user is making the request from. However, it
            could be a different country if the user is not located in a
            country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form
            &lt;language code&gt;-&lt;country code&gt;. For example, en-US. The
            string is case insensitive. If known, you are encouraged to always
            specify the market. Specifying the market helps Bing route the
            request and return an appropriate and optimal response. If you
            specify a market that is not listed in Market Codes, Bing uses a
            best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is subject
            to change. This parameter and the cc query parameter are mutually
            exclusive—do not specify both.
            </param>
        <param name="offset">
            The zero-based offset that indicates the number of search results
            to skip before returning results. The default is 0. The offset
            should be less than (totalEstimatedMatches - count). Use this
            parameter along with the count parameter to page results. For
            example, if your user interface displays 10 search results per
            page, set count to 10 and offset to 0 to get the first page of
            results. For each subsequent page, increment offset by 10 (for
            example, 0, 10, 20). it is possible for multiple pages to include
            some overlap in results.
            </param>
        <param name="promote">
            A comma-delimited list of answers that you want the response to
            include regardless of their ranking. For example, if you set
            answerCount) to two (2) so Bing returns the top two ranked answers,
            but you also want the response to include news, you'd set promote
            to news. If the top ranked answers are webpages, images, videos,
            and relatedSearches, the response includes webpages and images
            because news is not a ranked answer. But if you set promote to
            video, Bing would promote the video answer into the response and
            return webpages, images, and videos. The answers that you want to
            promote do not count against the answerCount limit. For example, if
            the ranked answers are news, images, and videos, and you set
            answerCount to 1 and promote to news, the response contains news
            and images. Or, if the ranked answers are videos, images, and news,
            the response contains videos and news. Possible values are
            Computation, Images, News, RelatedSearches, SpellSuggestions,
            TimeZone, Videos, Webpages. Use only if you specify answerCount.
            </param>
        <param name="responseFilter">
            A comma-delimited list of answers to include in the response. If
            you do not specify this parameter, the response includes all search
            answers for which there's relevant data. Possible filter values are
            Computation, Images, News, RelatedSearches, SpellSuggestions,
            TimeZone, Videos, Webpages. Although you may use this filter to get
            a single answer, you should instead use the answer-specific
            endpoint in order to get richer results. For example, to receive
            only images, send the request to one of the Image Search API
            endpoints. The RelatedSearches and SpellSuggestions answers do not
            support a separate endpoint like the Image Search API does (only
            the Web Search API returns them). To include answers that would
            otherwise be excluded because of ranking, see the promote query
            parameter.
            </param>
        <param name="safeSearch">
            A filter used to filter adult content. Off: Return webpages with
            adult text, images, or videos. Moderate: Return webpages with adult
            text, but not adult images or videos. Strict: Do not return
            webpages with adult text, images, or videos. The default is
            Moderate. If the request comes from a market that Bing's adult
            policy requires that safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the
            safeSearch value and uses Strict. If you use the site: query
            operator, there is the chance that the response may contain adult
            content regardless of what the safeSearch query parameter is set
            to. Use site: only if you are aware of the content on the site and
            your scenario supports the possibility of adult content. Possible
            values include: 'Off', 'Moderate', 'Strict'
            </param>
        <param name="setLang">
            The language to use for user interface strings. Specify the
            language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code. For example,
            the language code for English is EN. The default is EN (English).
            Although optional, you should always specify the language.
            Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt
            unless the user wants the user interface strings displayed in a
            different language. This parameter and the Accept-Language header
            are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface
            string is a string that's used as a label in a user interface.
            There are few user interface strings in the JSON response objects.
            Also, any links to Bing.com properties in the response objects
            apply the specified language.

        <param name="textDecorations">
            A Boolean value that determines whether display strings should
            contain decoration markers such as hit highlighting characters. If
            true, the strings may include markers. The default is false. To
            specify whether to use Unicode characters or HTML tags as the
            markers, see the textFormat query parameter.
            </param>
        <param name="textFormat">
            The type of markers to use for text decorations (see the
            textDecorations query parameter). Possible values are Raw—Use
            Unicode characters to mark content that needs special formatting.
            The Unicode characters are in the range E000 through E019. For
            example, Bing uses E000 and E001 to mark the beginning and end of
            query terms for hit highlighting. HTML—Use HTML tags to mark
            content that needs special formatting. For example, use &lt;b&gt;
            tags to highlight query terms in display strings. The default is
            Raw. For display strings that contain escapable HTML characters
            such as &lt;, &gt;, and &amp;, if textFormat is set to HTML, Bing
            escapes the characters as appropriate (for example, &lt; is escaped
            to &amp;lt;). Possible values include: 'Raw', 'Html'
            </param>
        <param name="customHeaders">
            The headers that will be added to request.
            </param>
        <param name="cancellationToken">
            The cancellation token.
