    <remarks>
      <para>
             Most Azure client libraries for .NET offer both synchronous and
             asynchronous methods for calling Azure services.  You can distinguish
             the asynchronous methods by their Async suffix.  For example,
             BlobClient.Download and BlobClient.DownloadAsync make the same
             underlying REST call and only differ in whether they block.  We
             recommend using our async methods for new applications, but there are
             perfectly valid cases for using sync methods as well.  These dual
             method invocation semantics allow for flexibility, but require a little
             extra care when writing event handlers.
             </para>
      <para>
             The SyncAsyncEventHandler is a delegate used by events in Azure client
             libraries to represent an event handler that can be invoked from either
             sync or async code paths.  It takes event arguments deriving from
             <see cref="T:Azure.SyncAsyncEventArgs" /> that contain important information for
             writing your event handler:
             <list type="bullet"><item><description><see cref="P:Azure.SyncAsyncEventArgs.CancellationToken" /> is a cancellation
             token related to the original operation that raised the event.  It's
             important for your handler to pass this token along to any asynchronous
             or long-running synchronous operations that take a token so cancellation
             (via something like
             <c>new CancellationTokenSource(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10)).Token</c>,
             for example) will correctly propagate.
             </description></item><item><description><see cref="P:Azure.SyncAsyncEventArgs.IsRunningSynchronously" /> is a flag indicating
             whether your handler was invoked synchronously or asynchronously.  If
             you're calling sync methods on your client, you should use sync methods
             to implement your event handler (you can return
             <see cref="P:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.CompletedTask" />).  If you're calling async methods on
             your client, you should use async methods where possible to implement
             your event handler.  If you're not in control of how the client will be
             used or want to write safer code, you should check the
             <see cref="P:Azure.SyncAsyncEventArgs.IsRunningSynchronously" /> property and call
             either sync or async methods as directed.
             </description></item><item><description>
             Most events will customize the event data by deriving from
             <see cref="T:Azure.SyncAsyncEventArgs" /> and including details about what
             triggered the event or providing options to react.  Many times this
             will include a reference to the client that raised the event in case
             you need it for additional processing.

      <para>
             When an event using SyncAsyncEventHandler is raised, the handlers will
             be executed sequentially to avoid introducing any unintended
             parallelism.  The event handlers will finish before returning control
             to the code path raising the event.  This means blocking for events
             raised synchronously and waiting for the returned <see cref="T:System.Threading.Tasks.Task" /> to
             complete for events raised asynchronously.
             </para>
      <para>
             Any exceptions thrown from a handler will be wrapped in a single
             <see cref="T:System.AggregateException" />.  If one handler throws an exception,
             it will not prevent other handlers from running.  This is also relevant
             for cancellation because all handlers are still raised if cancellation
             occurs.  You should both pass <see cref="P:Azure.SyncAsyncEventArgs.CancellationToken" />
             to asynchronous or long-running synchronous operations and consider
             calling <see cref="M:System.Threading.CancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested" />
             in compute heavy handlers.

             distributed tracing span</see> is wrapped around your handlers using
             the event name so you can see how long your handlers took to run,
             whether they made other calls to Azure services, and details about any
             exceptions that were thrown.

             Executing asynchronous code from a sync code path is commonly referred
             to as sync-over-async because you're getting sync behavior but still
             invoking all the async machinery. See
             <see href="https://docs.microsoft.com/archive/blogs/vancem/diagnosing-net-core-threadpool-starvation-with-perfview-why-my-service-is-not-saturating-all-cores-or-seems-to-stall">
             Diagnosing.NET Core ThreadPool Starvation with PerfView</see>
             for a detailed explanation of how that can cause serious performance
             problems.  We recommend you use the
             <see cref="P:Azure.SyncAsyncEventArgs.IsRunningSynchronously" /> flag to avoid
             ThreadPool starvation.

             If you're using the synchronous, blocking methods of a client (i.e.,
             methods without an Async suffix), they will raise events that require
             handlers to execute synchronously as well.  Even though the signature
             of your handler returns a <see cref="T:System.Threading.Tasks.Task" />, you should write regular
             sync code that blocks and return <see cref="P:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.CompletedTask" /> when
             finished.
             <code snippet="Snippet:Azure_Core_Samples_EventSamples_SyncHandler" language="csharp">
             var client = new AlarmClient();
             client.Ring += (SyncAsyncEventArgs e) =&gt;
             {
                 Console.WriteLine("Wake up!");
                 return Task.CompletedTask;

             client.Snooze();
             </code>
             If you need to call an async method from a synchronous event handler,
             you have two options.  You can use <see cref="M:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.Run(System.Action)" /> to
             queue a task for execution on the ThreadPool without waiting on it to
             complete.  This "fire and forget" approach may not run before your
             handler finishes executing.  Be sure to understand
             <see href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/exception-handling-task-parallel-library">
             exception handling in the Task Parallel Library</see> to avoid
             unhandled exceptions tearing down your process.  If you absolutely need
             the async method to execute before returning from your handler, you can
             call <c>myAsyncTask.GetAwaiter().GetResult()</c>.  Please be aware
             this may cause ThreadPool starvation.  See the sync-over-async note in
             Remarks for more details.

             If you're using the asynchronous, non-blocking methods of a client
             (i.e., methods with an Async suffix), they will raise events that
             expect handlers to execute asynchronously.

             The same event can be raised from both synchronous and asynchronous
             code paths depending on whether you're calling sync or async methods
             on a client.  If you write an async handler but raise it from a sync
             method, the handler will be doing sync-over-async and may cause
             ThreadPool starvation.  See the note in Remarks for more details.  You
             should use the <see cref="P:Azure.SyncAsyncEventArgs.IsRunningSynchronously" />
             property to check how the event is being raised and implement your
             handler accordingly.  Here's an example handler that's safe to invoke
             from both sync and async code paths.
