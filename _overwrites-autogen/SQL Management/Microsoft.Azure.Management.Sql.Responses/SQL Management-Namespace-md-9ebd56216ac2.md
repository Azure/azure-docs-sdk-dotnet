## Remarks  
 The Microsoft Azure SQL Database Management Library provides an easy way to add SQL management operations to your applications.  
  
 To install the current library, see [Microsoft Azure SQL Management Library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Management.Sql).  
  
 Many new features of SQL Database are only supported when using the [Azure Resource Manager deployment model](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/resource-group-overview/), so we recommend that you use the Azure SQL Database Management Library for .NET referenced in these pages (Microsoft.Azure.Management.Sql). The older classic deployment model library (Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Management.Sql) is supported for backward compatibility only. If you need the older classic library, you can still install it from  [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Management.Sql). For more information, see [Azure Resource Manager vs. classic deployment: Understand deployment models and the state of your resources](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/resource-manager-deployment-model/).
