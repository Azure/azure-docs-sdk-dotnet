## Remarks  
 This parameter is returned only if the subtask is in the completed             state. The exit code for a process reflects the specific             convention implemented by the application developer for that             process. If you use the exit code value to make decisions in your             code, be sure that you know the exit code convention used by the             application process. Note that the exit code may also be             generated by the compute node operating system, such as when a             process is forcibly terminated.
