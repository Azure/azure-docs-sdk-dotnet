## Remarks  
 This is an optional OData $filter expression string             (see the OData specification).             For example, you can restrict a [Microsoft.Azure.Batch](assetId:///N:Microsoft.Azure.Batch?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True) operation to return             only active pools with the expression `state eq 'active'`.  
  
 Filters must be specified using REST API attribute names, not .NET property names.  
  
 The default is no filter expression, which means all resources are returned.
