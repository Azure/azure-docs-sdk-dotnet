## Remarks  
 This property is only returned if the task is in the [Completed](assetId:///T:Microsoft.Azure.Batch.Common.JobReleaseTaskState?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True) state.              The exit code for a process reflects the specific convention implemented by the application developer for that              process. If you use the exit code value to make decisions in your code, be sure that you know the exit code convention              used by the application process. Note that the exit code may also be generated by the compute node operating              system, such as when a process is forcibly terminated.
