## Remarks  
 Note that the [SqlConnection](assetId:///T:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True) object returned by this call is not protected against transient faults.              Callers should follow best practices to protect the connection against transient faults in their application code, e.g., by using the transient fault handling              functionality in the Enterprise Library from Microsoft Patterns and Practices team.             All non-usage errors will be propagated via the returned Task.
