## Remarks  
 Note that the [SqlConnection](assetId:///T:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True) object returned by this call is not protected against transient faults.              Callers should follow best practices to protect the connection against transient faults              in their application code, e.g., by using the transient fault handling              functionality in the Enterprise Library from Microsoft Patterns and Practices team.             All non-usage error related exceptions are reported via the returned Task.
