## Remarks  
 Although NetMessaging is the default value, AMQP is the preferred protocol. No matter which transport type you select (NetMessaging or AMQP),              the communication occurs over the selected [ConnectivityMode](assetId:///T:Microsoft.ServiceBus.ConnectivityMode?qualifyHint=False&autoUpgrade=True). For example, you can have AMQP occur over TCP or HTTP(S).
