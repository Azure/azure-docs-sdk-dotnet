# Azure management libraries for .NET sample instructions

This article describes the prerequisites and authentication required for running the samples for the Azure management libraries for .NET.

## Prerequisties

* A [Microsoft Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* [Git command line client](https://git-scm.com/)

## Authentication for all samples

[!include[Create service principal](includes/create-sp.md)]

[!include[File-based authentication](includes/file-based-auth.md)]

## Running the samples

Once you have used Git to clone the sample, you can open the sample in Visual Studio and run the sample using the IDE.  Alternatively, use the .NET Core SDK to build and run the sample from the command line, like this:

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-dotnet-configure-deployment-sources-for-web-apps.git
cd app-service-dotnet-configure-deployment-sources-for-web-apps
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```
