# Tools for .NET and .NET Core Azure developers

## SDK downloads

Azure libraries for .NET are implemented as [NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=windowsazureofficial). See the [API Reference](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/?view=azure-dotnet) for installation instructions organized by Azure service.

## Development tools

Visual Studio has tooling for many Azure services built-in. Some Azure services have additional tools or emulators available, such as [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/). See the documentation for your Azure service for any additional tools, if necessary.

These instructions install the recommended starting development environment for your operating system.
