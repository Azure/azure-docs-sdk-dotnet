  summary: Re-order the route waypoints using a fast heuristic algorithm to reduce the route length. Yields best results when used in conjunction with routeType _shortest_. Notice that origin and destination are excluded from the optimized waypoint indices. To include origin and destination in the response, please increase all the indices by 1 to account for the origin, and then add the destination as the final index. Possible values are true or false. True computes a better order if possible, but is not allowed to be used in conjunction with maxAlternatives value greater than 0 or in conjunction with circle waypoints. False will use the locations in the given order and not allowed to be used in conjunction with routeRepresentation _none_.
