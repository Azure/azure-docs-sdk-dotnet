    This sample shows how to call GetReceivedShareAsync with required parameters and parse the result.


    ```

    var credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

    var endpoint = new Uri("<https://my-service.azure.com>");

    var client = new ReceivedSharesClient(endpoint, credential);


    Response response = await client.GetReceivedShareAsync("<receivedShareId>");


    JsonElement result = JsonDocument.Parse(response.ContentStream).RootElement;

    Console.WriteLine(result.GetProperty("shareKind").ToString());

    Console.WriteLine(result.GetProperty("id").ToString());

    Console.WriteLine(result.GetProperty("type").ToString());
