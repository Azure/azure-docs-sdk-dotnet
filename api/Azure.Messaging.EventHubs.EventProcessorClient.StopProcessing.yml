  summary: >-
    Signals the <xref data-throw-if-not-resolved="true" uid="Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.EventProcessorClient"></xref> to stop processing events.  Should this method be called while the processor

    is not running, no action is taken.
  remarks: <p>When stopping, the processor will update the ownership of partitions that it was responsible for processing and clean up network resources used for communication with the Event Hubs service.  As a result, this method will perform network I/O and may need to wait for partition reads that were active to complete.</p><p>Due to service calls and network latency, an invocation of this method may take slightly longer than the specified <xref data-throw-if-not-resolved="true" uid="Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.EventProcessorClientOptions.MaximumWaitTime"></xref> or if the wait time was not configured, the duration of the <xref data-throw-if-not-resolved="true" uid="Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.EventHubsRetryOptions.TryTimeout"></xref> of the configured retry policy.</p>
