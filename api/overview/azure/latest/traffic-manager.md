# Azure Traffic Manager libraries for .NET

## Overview

Microsoft Azure Traffic Manager allows you to control the distribution of user traffic for service endpoints in different datacenters. Service endpoints supported by Traffic Manager include Azure VMs, Web Apps, and cloud services. You can also use Traffic Manager with external, non-Azure endpoints.

## Management library

Install the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Management.TrafficManager.Fluent) directly from the Visual Studio [Package Manager console][PackageManager] or with the [.NET CLI][DotNetCLI]. This package is deprecated and no longer recommended for use.  The suggested alternative is [Azure.ResourceManager.TrafficManager](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.ResourceManager.TrafficManager/). For more information, refer to [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/overview/azure/resourcemanager.trafficmanager-readme?view=azure-dotnet) article.

#### Visual Studio Package Manager

```powershell
Install-Package Microsoft.Azure.Management.TrafficManager.Fluent
```

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Management.TrafficManager.Fluent
```
