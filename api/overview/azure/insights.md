# Azure Application Insights libraries for .NET

## Overview

Application Insights is an extensible monitoring & diagnostics service for web developers with powerful ad-hoc analytics capabilities. You can use the classes in the ApplicationInsights namespace to configure telemetry collection and send any custom telemetry from your applications that you want to monitor.

## Client library

The Application Insights client SDK for .NET allows you to log event, aggregated data, exceptions, dependency, and metrics to Azure for future analysis.

Install the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights ) directly from the Visual Studio [Package Manager console][PackageManager] or with the [.NET Core CLI][DotNetCLI].

#### Visual Studio Package Manager

```powershell
Install-Package Microsoft.ApplicationInsights 
```

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.ApplicationInsights 
```

### Example

This example tracks a custom event to Application Insights.

```csharp
TelemetryClient client = new TelemetryClient();
client.TrackEvent("MyCustomEvent");
```
